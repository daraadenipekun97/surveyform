                        <br>
                        <p>I'm sure many of you have heard of Postman before, if not go check it out it is an awesome
                            tool. Postman is <br> designed to help you make requests to web servers and control what
                            gets sent in without having to actually <br> create an HTML page or create Curl requests. If
                            you have ever created an API I'm sure you lived in Postman <br> as it is one of the easiest
                            ways to generate requests</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>So while Postman is great for simulating requests, what if you are working on the other side
                            of a project? If <br> you are writing a Single Page Application and you are going to be
                            using a RESTful API but it is still being <br> built how can you test your frontend code? Or
                            even if you are working on backend code and just need to <br> mock out a request to another
                            API, how can you test this without actually setting up your own server? <br> These are the
                            types of situations that TestApi.io was created for. We know there are other tools out there
                            <br> like Apiary and Swagger and even recommend them, however they can either cost money or
                            can be <br> somewhat complex to setup and host somewhere. So TestApi.io was created so you
                            can quickly setup <br> endpoints in a few seconds and keep working on your code</p>

                    <h1>About TestAPI</h1>
                    <p>TestApi.io was created by developers who at many times wish they had an easy way to setup a mock
                        api. We got sick and <br> tired of constantly setting up a simple application just to mock out
                        these requests so we created a simple tool to do this <br> for us. TestApi.io has a completely
                        free tier that still gives you access to all features. Hope this simple tool helps you out!</p>
